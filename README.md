# RTL2GDSII Flow using Opensource Tools - Power Management Unit FSM Design 🧠⚙️

This repository documents my learning journey through open-source ASIC design tools and methodologies using the **Skywater 130nm PDK**.  

Each day covers hands-on activities, tool usage, and theoretical understanding of VLSI design concepts — from RTL simulation to synthesis, STA, SPICE analysis, and PnR automation.

The structure of this repository is inspired by the RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop Flow by Kunal Ghosh

## 🗓️ Day 1 – Learning Open-Source Tools

**Installed Tools:**
- iVerilog  
- GTKWave  
- Yosys  
- OpenSTA  
- ngspice  
- Magic
- PnR using the automated flow (https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane)  

**Design Used:**  
good_shift_reg.v from (https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop)

- Verilog simulation performed using **iVerilog**  
- `.vcd` file generated and visualized using **GTKWave**
- PDK used: **Skywater 130nm**

**Design Insight (Shift Register = D Flip-Flop):**
- If **data arrives early** w.r.t clock → No setup/hold violation (data stable)
- If **data arrives late** w.r.t clock → **Setup violation** → Output updates **after 2 cycles** instead of 1

## 🗓️ Day 2 – Understanding Liberty Files (.lib)

**Topics Covered:**
- Structure of Liberty files (.lib)
- PVT Corners
- Leakage power and area information
- Cell delay tables

**Hands-on:**
- Synthesizing modules using **hierarchical** and **flat** methods
- Practiced **bottom-up synthesis** for sub-modules to optimize overall design

## 🗓️ Day 3 – Logic Optimization Techniques

**Topics Learned:**
- Constant Propagation  
- State Reduction  
- Retiming  
- Logic Cloning  

**Constant Propagation:**  
`Y = ~(A.B + C)` → If `A = 0` (constant), then `Y = ~C` (acts as an inverter).

**Logic Optimization Example:**
`assign y = a ? (b ? c : (c ? a : 0)) : (!c);`
Simplified to 
`y = ac + a.c' = a(c + c') = a`

**State Optimization - reduction of unused states**
Cloning - cloning a signal for better timing results

**Commands used here in Yosys** - 
`opt_clean -purge`
Opt_check = Mux with select signal = a and input = 0 and b → AND gate
Opt_check2 = Mux with select signal = a and input = 1 and b → OR gate
Opt_check3 = Mux with 2 select signals but one of each input is 0 → 3-input AND gate
and so on...

## 🗓️ Day 4 – Gate Level Simulation
Understanding the Gate Level Simulation ( Post-synthesis simulation ) to verify the functionality and logical correctness of the circuit which should be same as the pre-synthesis model.

---

## Day 5 - Constructs and Looping Statements
Learning about different constructs and looping statements in the design - if-else, for , case, generate. Understanding the issues of improper coding styles.

---

## 🗓️ Day 6 - PMU FSM Design RTL Coding

Design specs, RTL code and verification given in a different github repository : (to be added).

### 🗓️ Day 7 - Timing Report Generation for Single Corner - PMU FSM

***OpenSTA tool*** - timing reports of the PMU FSM are generated for one corner: ***sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80***

`P: TT, V: 1.8V, T: 25 degC`

pmu_constraints - consists of constraints used for the PMU FSM
pmu_fsm_sta -  tcl file used to generate the timing reports
Reports generated:
Power report
Setup/Hold timing report
Worst slack (min/max) report
Clock skew report
Max Tran/Max Cap violations report

---

### 🗓️ Day 8 - Use of Ngspice tool for SPICE Modeling 
Using ngspice tool, spice models of inverter VTC curve, inverter transient behaviour, NMOS I-V curves were simulated and analyzed


---

### 🗓️ Day 9 - Timing Report Generation for Multi Corner - PMU FSM 
***OpenSTA tool*** - timing reports for the PMU FSM were calculated at different PVT corners

change_process.py -  a python script to generate power and timing report summary of the different PVT corners
graph_analysis.py -  a python script to analyze the graphs for power and timing summary report ( setup and hold) at the different PVT corners

---

### 🗓️ Day 10 - OpenLane Tool Flow Generation - RTL2GDSII ( Openlane Version 1.1.1 ) (currently deprecated)

Completed the automated flow for PnR using Openlane tool for the PMU FSM Design and generated reports for analysis.

---

## Update :
I used the current Librelane (https://github.com/librelane) version and Skywater130nm PDK to complete the PD Flow and analyze the results of the Power Management Unit FSM Design. You can view the design and results in the new repository (to be added).
